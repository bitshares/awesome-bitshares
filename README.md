 The BitShares Blockchain is an industrial-grade decentralized platform
 built for high-performance financial smart contracts. It represents the
 first decentralized autonomous community that lets its core token
 holder decide on its future direction and products.
 In contrast to other smart contracting platform, its strict focus on
 security and reliabilty has allowed the BitShares Blockchain to become the
 largest host of decentralized exchanges.
